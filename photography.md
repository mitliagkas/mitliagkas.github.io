I appreciate people who engage on creative activity outside of work. 
I try to be like them.

<h2>Organizational</h2>

I'm an elected board member of the <a href="https://www.ergatikos-montreal.ca/en/home/">Association des travailleurs grecs du Québec</a> (greek workers' association of Quebec). 

<h2>Running</h2> 
I've <a href="https://resultscui.active.com/participants/33845739">dabbled</a> in long distance running and I'm recently back at it.



<h2>Music</h2>
<h3>Garlic Beets</h3>
In Texas, I survived the stress of grad school and emigration by founding a rebetiko band named Πατζάρια Σκορδαλιά (Patzaria Skordalia, which means Garlic Beets).

<h3>Music in Montreal</h3> 
Lately I play a variety of styles with many different musicians. Montreal is great for that! Some videos might come up soon.

<h2>Photography</h2>


Over the years I've been interested in photography, with mixed results.
